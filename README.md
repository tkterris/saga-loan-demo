# saga-loan-demo-manifests
k8s manifests for the saga-loan-demo application

## Setup

### Minikube setup

If you want to use Minikube, configure it with the following commands:

```
minikube config set rootless true
minikube start --driver=podman --container-runtime=containerd
minikube addons enable ingress
```

### All k8s

First, create the Kubernetes namespace and switch to that context:

```
kubectl apply -f k8s/manifests/base/saga-loan-demo-namespace.yaml
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=saga-loan-demo
```

If you're using non-public registries, configure a pull secret with the name `quayio`. For example:

```
kubectl create -f pullsecret.yml --namespace=NAMESPACEHERE
```

Check the `images` section of `k8s/manifests/base/kustomization.yaml` to ensure the correct registry locations and tags are being used. 
This includes the five application images, the LRA coordinator image, and the PostGres database image.

## Deployment

Run the following command to apply the configuration:

```
kubectl apply -k k8s/manifests/base
```

## Testing

### Happy Path

From within the cluster, requests can be sent to the create-loan application to test Saga functionality. The following command should work:

```
curl -X POST -d '{"id":1,"amount":50.00,"applicantId":1,"loanRequestDate":"2023-12-15T13:27:01","approved":false}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://create-loan:8080/saga/route
```

We can see that it completes as expected:

```

```

### Saga Compensation

With an invalid request, we get Saga compensation, as expected. When this command is tried:

```
# invalid, missing ID
curl -X POST -d '{"id":12345,"amount":50.00,"applicantId":1,"loanRequestDate":"2023-12-15T13:27:01","approved":false}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://create-loan:8080/saga/route
```

We then hit the `deleteLoan` Saga compensation step:

```
